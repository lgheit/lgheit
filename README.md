### Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project to forecast the effect of gasoline prices on consumer behavior.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning forecasting techniques and data analysis as part of a STEM-focused Finance Concentration. 

ðŸ¤” My goal is to keep learning! And to gain perspective, find meaning, and be grateful for the opportunity even as I am humbled along the way.
